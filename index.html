                <h1>AZTEC HUMAN SACRIFICE</h1>

            <p>Spanish missionary Fray Brenardino de Sahagun recorded a ritual child sacrifice performed by the Aztecs called Atl Caualo (“Ceasing of Water”):
            </p>
            <p><i>“The debts would be paid by someone, everywhere on mountaintops, and they would be made into paper streamers … And there they would leave them the little (noble) children, which they used to be called human paper streamers … it was being said ‘indeed they are precious blood sacrifices (debt payments)’ … it would make people cry, it made one break down crying, it caused them great pain, which indeed resulted in much sighing”</i></p>
            <p>In his memoirs, Spanish conquistador Andres de Tapia noted that he and a fellow Spaniard, Gonzalo de Umbria, approached the Great Temple in the Aztec capital, only to discover that down its steps ran a river of human blood – some stained, some congealed, some fresh – and a great skull rack containing what Tapia approximated to be 136,000 human skulls. </p>
            <p>Naturally, it seems almost fantastical to modern day people that a society would perform such large scale human sacrifices, but to the ancient Aztecs, this was an absolute requirement for their world view</p>
            <p>In order to best understand the significance of ritual human sacrifice in ancient Aztec religion, it is necessary to examine the worldly elements of Mesoamerica and the ways in which Aztec culture had been influenced by this geographical region.</p>
