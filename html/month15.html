        <h1>Panquetzaliztli</h1>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Ritual Overview</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Prior to the feast of Panquetzaliztli, the priests had all fisted for 80 days and laid down green boughs (consisting of green reeds and thorns). The fast began on the day following the month of Ochpaniztli; at midnight, these green boughs were spread on top of all the mountaintops and circular altars.</p>
        <p>Once the previous feast ended, then began the singing and dancing to the tune of Tlaxotecaiotl – the song of Uitzilopochtli.So, for the next 20 days, the men and women danced. And when the ninth day before the feast arrived, the taken captives were bathed in sacred water – water obtained by the old priests from the village of Uitzilopochco, at a spring called Uitzilatl.</p>
        <p>Henceforth, the water was sprinkled upon the victims at the foot of the Temple of Uitzilopochtli. The captives were given their paper vestments – painted with blue stripes from their feet to their knees and their elbows to their hands – that they were to die in. Their faces were stained in horizontal colors of light blue and yellow; they wore nose plugs made of arrow and a half disc.</p>
        <p>The fifth day before the feast, both they who owned the captive slaves and the old men of the tribal temple began a fast; they only ate at midday, and bathed at midnight. </p>
        <p>The woman who was to bathe the captive slaves bathed herself at the water’s edge and set up one thorn, stained with blood, at the bank. </p>
        <p>Once the four days of fasting had past, so began the serpent dance, among the captives, captors, and those who were to bathe them.</p>
        <p>On the twentieth day – the day of the feast – the captives returned to their owners house carrying with them black stain or blue mineral earth or red ochre. Upon reaching their owner’s house, they dipped their hands inn whatever material they brought with and laid their hands upon the posts and doorhandles of their owner’s home.</p>
        <p>After this was done, the captives were permitted to adorn themselves with whatever clothes they pleased, and were given many gifts. Then, they departed to the tribal temple, where they placed the gifts and danced in the courtyard. </p>
        <p>Then, once all gifts had been given, they climbed to the top of the pyramid temple and circled around the sacrificial stone, climbing down the other side; once they had set foot on the earth, each captive ran back to their tribal temples. Their, a vigil was held for them all night.</p>
        <p>At midnight, hair was cut from the top of their heads, and they all ate tamales.</p>
        <p>The next day, he who carried the figure of Paynal came down to the place called the god’s ball court; here, they slew four victims: two honoring the god Amapan, and two honoring the god Uapatzan. After they were slain, they were dragged about the ball court, as though painting it with blood.</p>
        <p>Then the priest with the figure of Paynal proceeded to Tlatilulco, then Nonoalco, where he greeted a priest bearing the image of the god Quauitl icac, helper and elder brother of Paynal. His clothes were similar to Payanl, though he was covered in chalk.</p>
        <p>Thus, both went forth to Tlaxotlan, and swiftly to Popotlan, where they slew more victims. Then, to Chapoltepetl and a river bank at a place named Izquitlan, where they also slew a victim whomst they named Izquiteccatl. They then went to Tepetocan, then Coyoacan, then Macatkan, then Acachinanco.  </p>
        <p>Once reaching Acachinanco, the paper stopped rolling: for someone began rolling paper once Paynal had started his journey. Thus, the paper stopped rolling, and a mock battle began in which many captives were slain. </p>
        <p>Eventually, the remaining captives were taken to the pyramid and arranged in order; from the top of the pyramid, a priest brought down the sacrificial papers as an offering to the four d irections, and laid  these in the eagle vessel. Likewise descended the fire serpent, made of red arara feathers and a tail of paper. The fire serpent was also raised as an offering to the four directions; both the serpent and the papers were then burned. </p>
        <p>After this, Paynal, the representative of Uitzilopochtli, came down from the summit to guide the captives and bathed ones up the pyramid steps. Then, the captives were slainl and the trumpets were sounded. Then, the bathed ones were slain; and the trumpets were once again sounded. </p>
        <p>The next day, all who was of age drank wine. If a youth was caught drinking, he was beaten with pine staffs, potentially to the point of death. Many gifts were given to the whom of those who had bathed the victims. </p>
        <p>The next day was called “The mock fight of the Chonchayotl”, and the young men and priests began skirmishing. If a young warrior caught a priest, they rubbed him with powdered maguey leaves until he burned and itched; if a priest caught a young warrior, the priest bled his ears, arms, breast, and thighs with a maguey thorn. </p>
        <p>The next day was called “Ashes are scattered”, as it was believed the bathed ones still walked upon the earth and have not yet departed tot the land of the dead. So, all their paper vestments were again burned, and every individual washed their heads with soap and bathed.</p>
