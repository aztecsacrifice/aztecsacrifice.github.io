        <h3>“The God Arriveth”</h3>
        <p>Five days before the end of the month, the youthd began spreading branches of fir in every home, offering the idols a small basket of maize. On rhe third day of the spreading of the branches came Tezcatlipea. And offerings were laid out for him. </p>
        <p>When the fourth day came, thus concluded the scattering of branches; the branches were all thrown away. </p>
        <p>At midnight the fourth day, the priests prepared a flour of maize, which was pressed round and flat, and placed upon a map. The priest who made thsus was called the old priest, and he spent his time looked upon the maize flour, waiting for it to split, signalling that the gods have arrived. Thus, he proclaimed “Verily, the lord hath deigned to come”. When this was heard, all the priests went in precession, blowing shell trumpets.</p>
        <p>The next day came Yacapitzauac, the god of the merchants, and Xiuhtecutli, who was also god of the merchants. Then, many, many captives were cast into the large altar and burnt.  (squirrel costume) (bat costume)</p>
