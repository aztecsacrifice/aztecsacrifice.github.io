        <p>Below is the <i>xiuhp≈çhualli</i>, one of the two primary calendars used by the Aztecs.</p><br>
        <p>The Aztec timekeeping system was almost entirely cyclicical, as opposed to the semi-linear timekeeping method we use today.</p>
        <p>This was a great way to determine the intervals between ritual celebrations, but on a broader scale, it represented the whole of the Aztec's relationship with nature.</p>
        <p>Aztec religion is characterized primarily by a form of monism called "teotl", much like the concept of dao in daoism or the concept of brahman in hinduism</p>
        <p>Despite this, the Aztec's still worshipped a pantheon of dieties that encompassed various elements of the material world -- and understanding the representation of the deities in regards to the elements they personify is the key to understanding how Aztec ritual makes perfect sense.</p>
