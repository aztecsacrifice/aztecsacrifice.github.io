            This was when all the captives died -- all those taken in war: men, women, children. <br>
The prisoners who were to die began to dance at noon; those who had taken captives held an aaall-nght vigil for their prisoners in the tribal temple. After half the night had passed, they took offerings of hair and blood from the prisoners.<br>
When dawn came, all the prisoners were made to leave and die -- these captives were called xipeme and tototecti, and were slew by priests.<br>
The priests dragged them up the stairs of the temple Uitzilopochtli, ontop of which they were stretched upon a sacrificial stone. Then, the priest threw them upon their backs and took their hearts, namin the hearts "precious eagle-cactus fruit"; these were lifted up to the sun, as an offering. The hearts were then placed in the "eagle vessel"; hence, these captives were known as "eagle men".<br>
Then, the captives were pushed down the stairs of the temple. The old men -- the quaquacuilti -- took each captive back to their tribal temples. Here, they cut the captives up into pieces -- saving the thigh for Moctezuma -- so that their respective captors may eat the captive.<br>
The captor was given a down of birds to his had and gifts; then, the captor summoned his relatives so they may all feast upon the captive. <br>
Everyone was given a bowl of stew of dried maize called tlacatlaolli, in which in each a piece of the flesh of the captive was set.<br>
The captor was named "the sun", "white earth", "the feather", as he was decked with feathers because he had not died there in the war, but was yet to die and would pay his debt, either in war or by sacrifice. <br>
The next day, the glaiatorial sacrifice was made. A vigil was held all night for the captives that were to be sacrificed.<br>
From those whom would offer sacrifice, they took hair from a midnight; this was called "the sening upward of the eagle man" because he who died in war into the presence of the sun. That is, he did not go to the land of the dead. So whoever took his hair, kept his hair safe. Thus, this captive was given many honors and riches. <br>
He who took the captive was adorned at the temple of Tecanman (in Tenochtitlan) with white turkey down, the feathers being pasted upon him. The place where, arranged in order the tototecti remained, was upon white earth or grass, on which they waited.<br>
