        <h1>Tocoztontli</h1>
        <h3>“the offering of flowers”</h3>
        <p>The feast was called “the offering of flowers”, for all the various flowers that had recently blossomed. If anyone was to smell they flowers, they were to provide the flowers with an offering, such as a stone. </p>
        <p>The human skins from the previous month were then hidden away buried at the Temple of Yopitli. The captors were to wear their respective captive’s skin – which was often foul smelling and deteriorating – as ceremony; at the temple, the captors took off the skins. Those who disposed of the skins washed themselves with flour instead of water, and slapped their skin when bathing. The captors all washed their heads. During the prior 20 days, they had fasted; yet, they had not bathed.</p>
        <p>After the captor washed his head, he adorned himself with the paper vestments of Xipe and chased people down with a shield and rattle board. He was widely feared and pelted with rocks, as people screamed “now cometh he who hath washed his head”. If he seized someone, he stole his cloak and took it back to his house.</p>
        <p>The captor dressed as Xipe then made a “pole of the flaying of men” in his yard out of the cloaks – a symbol to show he had flayed a captive; on this pole he also attached the thigh bone of his captive, alongside a small spray of heron feathers. The thigh bone was wrapped in paper and given a mask and was then called the “god-captive”.</p>
