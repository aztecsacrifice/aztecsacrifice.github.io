        <p>For five days, nothing happened. For the next eight does, the ahdn-waving dance began.</p>
        <p>Then, a woman with the likeness of Toci was chosen, and, knowing she was to die, many of the other women tried to make her laugh, for it was said if she wept, it would be an omen of evil.</p>
        <p>For the next four days, a mock fight pursued.</p>
        <p>After this was over, Toci was received by the priests of Chicome coatl; as she took her leave, she scattered cornmeal upon to ground, trampling it. The other women spent much time consoling her. They told her that she was not to die, because it was required that she die unaware. </p>
        <p>At midnight, Toci was taken to the top of a temple a beheaded, then quickly flayed. A priest – now known as Teccizquacuilli – donned her skin.Her thigh was flayed and put upon he had possessed the likeness of Toci’s son, Cinteotl. </p>
        <p>Then, Teccizquacuilli (as Toci) was to slay four captives, stretching them upon the sacrificial stone and cutting open their hearts. The rest of the captives were sacrificed by the fire priest. </p>
        <p>Cinteotl then, alongside a few warriors, went t the mountain Popotl temi, and fashioned the mask made from the  skin of Toci’s thigh to a wooden frame, and departed.</p>
        <p>Later that datm many of the warriors met with Moctezuma and received gifts and were richly adorned with much gold and many quetzal feathers, as the old women watched in grieve, worried as to if their son’s would die in battle.</p>
        <p>Then came forth the priests of Chicome coatl, representatives of those wearing the skins of flayed sacrificial victims, who, when Toci died, also died at the same time. The climbed the pyramid of Uitzilopochtli, flinging and scattering seeds upon onlookers: white, yellow, black, red maize grains, and squash seeds. Then, the fire priest came down from the pyramid and placed, at its base, a wooden vessel of white chalk and feathers. </p>
        <p>As soon as it had been placed, all the chiefs ran to it; whoever got their first quickly took a handful of feathers. Subsequently, the other chiefs also took handfuls of feathers.</p>
        <p>As they were taking feathers, the wearer of the skin of the likeness of Toci stood nearby and followed them, chanting war cries. And when the wearer of the skin of Toci went, everyone spat at her and whoever had flowers in his hands threw flowers at her. </p>
        <p>Toci eventually ran to Tocititlan alongside a few priests, and the Toci skin was then taken off and stretched upon a wooden frame as an image.</p>
