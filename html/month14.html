        <p>Once the previous month ended, nothing was done for five days. After these five days, everyone offered reeds for arrows, and the warriors took them and straightened them in the fire. On the third day after the five had ended, everyone gathered around as the small boys were taken up to the top of the pyramid temple and cut blood from their ears, anointing their temples with it. It was thus said: “The deer are [anointed] with blood”; they fasted for the deer, that they might hunt them. </p>
        <p>After, they assembled in the courtyard and finished preparing arrows; each man drew blood, and if a man was not caught drawing his own blood, they stripped him of his cape.</p>
        <p>The fourth day was called “Arrows are made for the homes”, as all men made arrows in their homes. </p>
        <p>On the fifth day, they were only concerned with the dead; for these, they made small arrows and lay them where the dead had been buried, alongside two sweet tamales. They remained there all day until sundown, when the offerings were then burned for the dead.</p>
        <p>The sixth day was named “They come upon the grass”, for grass from under the pine trees was scattered in the Temple of Mixcoatl. </p>
        <p>After, everyone departed to Zacatioex to hunt. They slept in grass shelters and hunted deer, coyotes, rabbits, and hares. If one caugh a deer or coyote, Moctzemu gifted them with a cape whose edhes were striped with feathers.</p>
        <p>When ten days remained in the month, the held in feast in the honor of the God id the otomi,  named Mixcoatl. </p>
        <p>When they went upon the grass, paper vestments were offered to as many as would die. For the god Tlamatzincatl, many of his bathed sacrificial victims were arrayed, For the god Izquitecatl, two or three were bathed, Two victims then also died for Mixcoatl and his consort, Yeuatl icue. </p>
        <p>So when time had finally come for the feast of Quecholli, then those who were to die went into the sand. They were taken in precession to the offering stone, encircled it abd walked back down the pyramid steps. Then, they were taken to the tribal teples for a vigil, where, at midnight, hair was taken from the crown of their heads and all their belongings were burned. </p>
        <p>At dawn, they adorned their paper vestments, in which they were to die. They were taken again to the foot of the pyramid, where four of the captives had their feet and hands bound, as priests carried them up the stairs and hence slew them upon the offering stone. </p>
        <p>After, all the other captives went up on their own volition. After these captives have died, those bearing the likeness of Mixcoatl died; then those with the likeness of Tlamatzincatl/ And at dawn, the women died at the Temple of Coatlan; some went up the steps dancing, others wept. </p>
