        <p>This is not considered a month, nor is there any ritual involved; in fact, the whole point of <i>nemontemi</i> is to do nothing</p>
        <p>These are the five remaining days in which the Aztec calendar could not prescribe a month to.</p>
        <p>Anyone who was born on these days had no day sign, and therefore no meaning. They were given the name "Nemo" and was cursed to live in poverty upon earth</p>
        <p>As a result, it the Aztecs often feared these days and made a point out of doing nothing.</p>
