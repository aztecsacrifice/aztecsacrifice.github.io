        <h1>Atl Caualo</h1> 
        <h3>"ceasing of water"</h3>
        <p>
            First, a feast was celebrated for the Tlalocs (rain gods). <br>
            Blood sacrifices were made at Tepetzinco, or at Pantitlan -- here, they left consecrated papers and set up long poles called cuenmnantli. Here, they took the children known as "human banners" -- those chiddren who had two cowlicks whose day signs were favorable. They were thought to be the most precious blood-offerings, and were given to the rain gods in hope of rain. Everywhere they ereced cuenmantli, on which they placed white paper flags dotted with drops of liquid rubber. <br>
            They took the children to many different places: <br>
            First, Quahtepec. The one who died here bore the same name "Quautepetl"; his paper vestments were brown. <br>
            Second, Mount Yoaltecatl. This child was named "Yoltecatl"; his paper vestman was black striped with red. <br>
            Third, Tepetzinco. This child was named "Quetzalxock", dressed in blue. <br>
            Fourth, Poyauhtlan, at the foot of Mount Tepetzinco. This child was named "Poyauhtecatl" and adorned in stripes of liquid rubber. <br>
            Fifth, a place in the middle of a lake, Pantitlan. This child was called "Epcoactl"; his vestments were set with mussel shells. <br>
            Sixth, the top of the hill of Cocotl. This child was named "Cocotl"; he was dressed in both red and brown. <br>
            Seventh, on the summit of Yiahqueme. This child bore the name "Yiahqueme", and his clothes were completely brown. <br>
            All of these children wore head-band with "sprays and sprigs of quetzal feathers; they had green stone necklaces, and they went provided with green stone bracelets...Their faces were painted with liquid rubber, and spotted with a paste of amaranth seeds...they had sandals of liquid rubber...they gave them paper wings...they were carried in litteeers covered with quetzal feathers...and they went sounding flutes for them" <br>
            During this time, everyone mourned loudly. It was said that if the children began to cry, they rain would indeed begin. <br>
            The children were brought to Yopico, Totex's temple, where they would participate in a mock battle in the same way they would later die -- as they would tear their hearts out of them. <br>
            Four times these children appeared before the people: <br>
            First time, they were dressed in red. <br>
            Second time, they were dressed in white. <br>
            Third time, red again. <br>
            And fourth, again, white. After this, the children were taken and slain. <br>
