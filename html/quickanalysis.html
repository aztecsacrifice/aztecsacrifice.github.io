        <h1>How the Aztec's Environment Shaped their Ritual Practice</h1> <br>
        <p>The Aztec's viewed themselves all of reality as a singularity; their physical dimension often coincided with the mythological. Nearly all the sacrifices were imitations of mythos -- this is easily seen in celebrations like Toci, the maize goddess. It has been said that the Templo Mayor (the main temple of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital) was representative of the fictional mountain of Coatepec, on which the gods lived (see: <i>Mapping the Aztec Capital: The 1524 Nuremberg Map of Tenochtitlan</i>)</p>
        <p>Tlalocs were the rain gods; these were divines that brought upon rain, which were essential to harvesting maize and were the primary gods associated with flowers. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important dieties were the fire or sun dieties: the Aztecs had a specific "fire priest" and oftentimes offered hearts to the sun divines to pay retribution for the gift of heat (see: <i>Aztec Human Sacrifice as Expiation</i>)</p>
        <p>As seen throughout the rituals, sacrifices were often portrayed as a privilege. "Victims" were often given gifts and many adornments before being sacrificed, and some even "danced" and seemed happy to go (according to Sahagún's Florentine Codex)</p>
        <p>Sacrifice was a way to keep the world in cosmic order, essentially.</p>
        <p>Frequently used elements throughout rituals (such as rubber or quetzal feathers) all had great symbolic meaning as well: the portrayal of the divine incorporated these natural materials. For example, white feather down was often used to portray "the sky" in both ritual practice and illustration of the divines (see: <i>The materiality of color in the body ornamentation of Aztec gods</i>)</p>
        <p>As stated by Clifford Geertz: “Religion is (1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic” (1973, 90).</p>
        <p>Essentially, this definition establishes percisely the relationship the Aztecs had with the ritualistic dimension and religion: their symbolism was used to establish a way of life, though this way of life was also used to establish their symbolism; thus, their religious beliefs were, like their timekeeping methods, inherently cyclical and dependent on both the natural and divine realms.
