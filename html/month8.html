            Before the celebration began, all the poor in Mexico came to gather in Tenochititlan to drink a lime-leaved sage powered drink mixed with water, which was mixed in a canoe and sweetened in honey. This was drunk from a vessel called a ticapanqui. If anyone were to attempt to take more than his share of atolli, he was whacked with green canes.
At noon, everyone was served tamales, either made of maize or fruit or lime or honey. If someone should try to dishonestly take a tamale, he was struck with a cord made of reeds and his tamales were taken from him.
This was to showcase the chief’s benevolence. </p> <p>
Until the time of the Freat Feast, days were spent singing and dancigng  among all different likes of people, wearing clothes symbolic of their position in society and life. During the dance, if Moctezuma came forth, he danced alongside them. </p> <p>
Before the real feast, on the tenth day came Uei tecuilhuitl, when a woman with the likeness of Xilonen was to die. ((description of clothes because important))</p> <p>
Xilonen began her travels from Tetamancolco, to Necoquixecan, to Atenchicalan, and finally to Xolloco. These locations were chosen in  particular as they were a part of the four year bearerers – reed, flint, house, and rabbit – representing the cyclical nature of things.</p> <p>
Priestessess (clothing) </p><p>
The fire priest who was to slay Xilonen wore ((this)).</p> <p>
She was slain at the Temple of Cinteotl. Afterwardds, all, for the first time, ate green maize. During the Feast of the Great Lords, only the old men and old women could drink wine; anyone else caught drinking would potentially be executed.
