        <h1>THIS IS THE memo</h1>
        <p>Since the first draft, just about most things have changed since I just had a bunch of placeholder text without analysis. There's not as much analysis as I would like there to be right now (primarily because my computer was broken for the past month so I did everything on paper which is a lot to type out), but all the sources I have read through are cited on the "source" page.</p>
        <p>I was originally also going to tie in a bunch of the locations in the Aztec empire and explain their influence, hence some of the sources, but I realize that would take forever to link up which is unfortunate.</p>
        <p>Also, revised definition of religion to more closely fit with the specific theme.</p> <br>
